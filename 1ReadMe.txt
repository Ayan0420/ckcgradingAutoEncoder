"CKC Grading System Auto Encoder"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ INSTRUCTIONS FOR USAGE ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

** Before anything else, make sure that you are using the Excel format
   given by Sir Clark. 

	1.) Log in to the Grading Program you are going to encode and choose the
            class and subject you would like to input the raw score.

	2.) Enter the TOTAL RAW SCORES.

	3.) Run "Auto Encoder" that is located on your Desktop as Adminstrator (skip this part 
            if the program is already running after the installation). 
	          #Help: right-click "Auto Encoder" app and click "Run as Administrator"

	4.) Choose the Grading Program (Basic Ed or College).

	5.) Click "OPEN EXCEL" button then locate and select Excel file of your grading
            sheet.

	6.) Input the number of students in that class. Then, select the
            term in the dropdown(e.g. Prelim, Midterm, Finals)

	7.) Click "START AUTO ENCODING". Then, go back to the BasicEd
   	    Grading System and CLICK THE FIRST ENTRY of the "WW" and wait
            for the auto encoder to start.

NOTE: Once the encoding process has started, DO NOT PRESS KEYS OR MOVE YOUR MOUSE. If the 
      encoding messed up, move your mouse on the UPPER-RIGHT CORNER of the screen to abort
      the process, after that, close the program.


Enjoy being productive!!!!
